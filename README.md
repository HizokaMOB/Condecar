In the repository we are building a software for the management of an automotive, this is for academic purposes for the subject of software construction project, this is not part of any company, the project is public but the distribution of the code without the authorization of the creators is prohibited.

# Description
This project is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) adapted to the needs of the automotive industry. 

This CRM will be a fundamental tool to manage effective relationships with customers and suppliers in a highly competitive market.

This Automotive CRM project seeks to provide companies in the automotive industry with a strategic tool to manage and optimize their business relationships, thus improving their competitiveness and success in the market.


# Set Up
First, the extensions required for the execution of the project are: Spring Boot Dash Board, Spring Boot Extension Pack, Spring Boot Tools, Spring Initializr Java Support, Thymeleaf Snippets. In this software we used MySQL Workbench as database, in case you want to use the same one, the extensions are: MySQL, MySQL Syntax. 

The dependencies are added automatically to the file "pom.xml" once we install the extensions, in case that an error occurs with the connection to MySQL, it is probable that the dependency is not there and we have to put it manually.

In this software the Java Framework known as Spring Boot was used, the programming language in which it was developed is Java, and the programming environment in which it was developed is Visual Studio Code.

Note: to execute the project we have to go to the activity bar in the part of "Spring Boot Dashboard", then we press the "run" button that appears in the "APPS" section with our file, after being executed we put the mouse over our file and select the icon that appears there, then we copy the address that appears in the generated window and paste it in the browser with the route and the port that we have indicated in the code.
